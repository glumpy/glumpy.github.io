<h1>Modern OpenGL<a class="headerlink" href="#modern-opengl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>OpenGL has evolved over the years and a big change occured in 2003 with the
introduction of the dynamic pipeline (OpenGL 2.0), i.e. the use of shaders that
allow to have direct access to the GPU.</p>
<img alt="_images/gl-history.png" src="_images/gl-history.png" />
<p>Before this version, OpenGL was using a fixed pipeline and you may still find a
lot of tutorials that still use this fixed pipeline. This introduces some
radical changes in the way of programming OpenGL and makes it both more
difficult to program but far more powerful.</p>
<div class="section" id="shaders">
<h2>Shaders<a class="headerlink" href="#shaders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The shader language is called glsl.  There are many versions that goes from 1.0
to 1.5 and subsequents version get the number of OpenGL version. Last version
is 4.4 (February 2014).</p>
</div>
<p>Shaders are pieces of program (using a C-like language) that are build onto the
GPU and executed during the rendering pipeline. Depending on the nature of the
shaders (there are many types depending on the version of OpenGL you're using),
they will act at different stage of the rendering pipeline. To simplify this
tutorial, we'll use only <strong>vertex</strong> and <strong>fragment</strong> shader as shown below:</p>
<img alt="_images/gl-pipeline.png" src="_images/gl-pipeline.png" />
<p>A vertex shader acts on vertices and is supposed to output the vertex
<strong>position</strong> (→ <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gl_Position</span></code>) on the viewport (i.e. screen). A fragment shader
acts at the fragment level and is supposed to output the <strong>color</strong>
(→ <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gl_FragColor</span></code>) of the fragment. Hence, a minimal vertex shader is:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>void main()
{
    gl_Position = vec4(0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0);
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>while a minimal fragment shader would be:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>void main()
{
    gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0);
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>These two shaders are not very useful since the first will transform any
vertex into the null vertex while the second will output the black color for
any fragment. We'll see later how to make them to do more useful things.</p>
<p>One question remains: when are those shaders exectuted exactly ? The vertex
shader is executed for each vertex that is given to the rendering pipeline
(we'll see what does that mean exactly later) and the fragment shader is
executed on each fragment that is generated after the vertex stage. For
example, in the simple figure above, the vertex would be called 3 times, once
for each vertex (1,2 and 3) while the fragment shader would be executed 21
times, once for each fragment (pixel).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="buffers">
<h2>Buffers<a class="headerlink" href="#buffers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We explained earlier that the vertex shader act on the vertices. The question
is thus where do those vertices comes from ? The idea of modern GL is that
vertices are stored on the GPU and needs to be uploaded (only once) to the GPU
before rendering. The way to do that is to build buffers onto the CPU and to
send them onto the GPU. If your data does not change, no need to upload it
again. That is the big difference with the previous fixed pipeline where data
were uploaded at each rendering call (only display lists were built into GPU
memory).</p>
<p>But what is the structure of a vertex ? OpenGL does not assume anything about
your vertex structure and you're free to use as many information you may need
for each vertex. The only condition is that all vertices from a buffer have the
same structure (possibly with different content). This again is a big
difference with the fixed pipeline where OpenGL was doing a lot of complex
rendering stuff for you (projections, lighting, normals, etc.) with an implicit
fixed vertex structure. Now you're on your own...</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Good news</strong> is that you're now free to do virtually anything you want.</li>
<li><strong>Bad news</strong> is that you have to program everything, even the most basic
things like projection and lighting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's take a simple example of a vertex structure where we want each vertex to
hold a position and a color. The easiest way to do that in python is to use a
structured array using the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.numpy.org">numpy</a> library:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">numpy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">zeros</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dtype</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;position&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">float32</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">),</span>
                                <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;color&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>    <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">float32</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)]</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We just created a CPU buffer with 4 vertices, each of them having a
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">position</span></code> (3 floats for x,y,z coordinates) and a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">color</span></code> (4 floats for
red, blue, green and alpha channels). Note that we explicitely chose to have 3
coordinates for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">position</span></code> but we may have chosen to have only 2 if were to
work in two-dimensions only. Same holds true for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">color</span></code>. We could have used
only 3 channels (r,g,b) if we did not want to use transparency. This would save
some bytes for each vertex. Of course, for 4 vertices, this does not really
matter but you have to realize it <strong>will matter</strong> if you data size grows up to
one or ten million vertices.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="uniform-attribute-varying">
<h2>Uniform, attribute, varying<a class="headerlink" href="#uniform-attribute-varying" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At this point in the tutorial, we know what are shaders and buffers but we
still need to explain how they may be connected together. So, let's consider
again our CPU buffer:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">numpy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">zeros</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dtype</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;position&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">float32</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">),</span>
                                <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;color&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>    <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">float32</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)]</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We need to tell the vertex shader that it will have to handle vertices where a
position is a tuple of 3 floats and color is a tuple of 4 floats. This is
precisely what attributes are meant for. Let us change slightly our previous
vertex shader:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>attribute vec2 position;
attribute vec4 color;
void main()
{
    gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This vertex shader now expects a vertex to possess 2 attributes, one named
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">position</span></code> and one named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">color</span></code> with specified types (vec3 means tuple of
3 floats and vec4 means tuple of 4 floats). It is important to note that even
if we labeled the first attribute <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">position</span></code>, this attribute is not yet bound
to the actual <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">position</span></code> in the numpy array. We'll need to do it explicitly
at some point in our program and there is no automagic that will bind the numpy
array field to the right attribute, you'll have to do it yourself, but we'll
see that later.</p>
<p>The second type of information we can feed the vertex shader are the uniforms
that may be considered as constant values (across all the vertices). Let's say
for example we want to scale all the vertices by a constant factor <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">scale</span></code>,
we would thus write:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>uniform float scale;
attribute vec2 position;
attribute vec4 color;
void main()
{
    gl_Position = vec4(position*scale, 0.0, 1.0);
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Last type is the varying type that is used to pass information between the
vertex stage and the fragment stage. So let us suppose (again) we want to pass
the vertex color to the fragment shader, we now write:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>uniform float scale;
attribute vec2 position;
attribute vec4 color;
varying vec4 v_color;

void main()
{
    gl_Position = vec4(position*scale, 0.0, 1.0);
    v_color = color;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and then in the fragment shader, we write:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>varying vec4 v_color;

void main()
{
    gl_FragColor = v_color;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The question is what is the value of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">v_color</span></code> inside the fragment shader ?
If you look at the figure that introduced the gl pipleline, we have 3 vertices and 21
fragments. What is the color of each individual fragment ?</p>
<p>The answer is <em>the interpolation of all 3 vertices color</em>. This interpolation
is made using distance of the fragment to each individual vertex. This is a
very important concept to understand. Any varying value is interpolated between
the vertices that compose the elementary item (mostly, line or triangle).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="transformations">
<h2>Transformations<a class="headerlink" href="#transformations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="projection-matrix">
<h3>Projection matrix<a class="headerlink" href="#projection-matrix" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We need first to define what do we want to view, that is, we need to define a
viewing volume such that any object within the volume (even partially) will be
rendered while objects outside won't. On the image below, the yellow and red
spheres are within the volume while the green one is not and does not appear on
the projection.</p>
<img alt="_images/ViewFrustum.png" src="_images/ViewFrustum.png" />
<p>There exist many different ways to project a 3D volume onto a 2D screen but
we'll only use the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)">perspective projection</a> (distant objects
appear smaller) and the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_projection_(geometry)">orthographic projection</a> which is a
parallel projection (distant objects have the same size as closer ones) as
illustrated on the image above. Until now (previous section), we have been
using implicitly an orthographic projection in the z=0 plane.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">In older versions of OpenGL, these matrices were available as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man2/xhtml/glFrustum.xml">glFrustum</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man2/xhtml/glOrtho.xml">glOrtho</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Depending on the projection we want, we will use one of the two projection matrices
below:</p>
<p><strong>Perspective matrix</strong></p>
<img alt="_images/frustum-matrix.png" src="_images/frustum-matrix.png" />
<p><strong>Orthographic matrix</strong></p>
<img alt="_images/ortho-matrix.png" src="_images/ortho-matrix.png" />
<p>At this point, it is not necessary to understand how these matrices were built.
Suffice it to say they are standard matrices in the 3D world. Both suppose the
viewer (=camera) is located at position (0,0,0) and is looking in the direction
(0,0,1).</p>
<p>There exists a second form of the perpective matrix that might be easier to
manipulate. Instead of specifying the right/left/top/bottom planes, we'll use
field of view in the horizontal and vertical direction:</p>
<p><strong>Perspective matrix</strong></p>
<img alt="_images/perspective-matrix.png" src="_images/perspective-matrix.png" />
<p>where <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fovy</span></code> specifies the field of view angle, in degrees, in the y
direction and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">aspect</span></code> specifies the aspect ratio that determines the field
of view in the x direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="model-and-view-matrices">
<h3>Model and view matrices<a class="headerlink" href="#model-and-view-matrices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We are almost done with matrices. You may have guessed that the above matrix
requires the viewing volume to be in the z direction. We could design our 3D
scene such that all objects are withing this direction but it would not be very
convenient. So instead, we'll use a view matrix that will map the the world
space to camera space. This is pretty much as if we were orienting the camera
at a given position and look toward a given direction. In the meantime, we can
further refine the whole pipeline by providing a model matrix that will maps
the object's local coordinate space into world space. For example, this wil be
useful for rotating an object around its center. To sum up, we need:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Model matrix</strong> maps from an object's local coordinate space into world space</li>
<li><strong>View matrix</strong> maps from world space to camera space</li>
<li><strong>Projection matrix</strong> maps from camera to screen space</li>
</ul>
